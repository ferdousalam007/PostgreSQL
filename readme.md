1) What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL or Postgres is a software system that allows the user to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It manages large volumes of information that may be present in websites or applications and aids in easy fetching of the said information when required.PostgreSQL is an extensible and adaptable tool that caters for the integration of user defined functions to large data handling capabilities also support for JSON storage making them an ideal tool in todayâ€™s application development.

2) What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

Database schema in PostgreSQL is a way to simply group our related data and make it easy to choose the table which we want. It is as a design document which contains tables, field and types of data among them along with the relationships . In order for data to be used efficiently they promote the continuity of data as well as their security.

3) Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL.

A primary among the constraints in any relational database generally includes a primary key. This is implemented to make sure that each row in a given table is identifiable.  A foreign key serves an altogether different purpose in relation to two tables that defines the relation of one table to another.

4) What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

 The VARCHAR data type can be used to store a variable length of text up to a specified maximum limit and makes use of only the amount of space that is required, On the other hand, CHAR is a data type that has a standard size in which smaller strings are filled with space and therefore best fit application when the data input will be of standard sizes.

5) Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.

In a SELECT statement, the WHERE clause enables filtering of records by defining certain conditions which return only the rows that fit the specified requirements. It improves the verbosity of the queries by providing a specific range of data from the database.

6) What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?

LIMIT restricts the number of rows we wish to retrieve from the result set. OFFSET on the other hand, ignores a certain amount of rows before the result is presented. These two functionalities are useful when pagination of the result set is applicable

7) How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?

It is the SQL command the UPDATE that enables you to modify data that has already been entered in a certain table. We can indicate what particular rows need to be updated by the WHERE clause and assign new values for the columns that we want to update.

8) What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL join helps to couple rows of a table column with any other column of a different table, that contains a matching column with the values in any of the other common columns between the related tables showing it as one combined result.

9)  Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.

The GROUP BY statement is helpful in organizing rows based on a selected column and calculating the defined operations on these organized rows. With aggregate manipulate data including COUNT, SUM, AVG etc.

10)  How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?

One can achieve condensed information by using aggregate functions.Specifically, COUNT function counts the number of records present in the rows, SUM function totals all inputted numbers, while AVG calculates the average. These are used in SELECT statements in order to obtain such results from given specific fields.
